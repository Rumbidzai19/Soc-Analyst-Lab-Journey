## Investigation Summary

**Alert Investigated:** Suspicious login detected  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Tools Used:** Splunk, Windows Event Logs, Threat Intelligence platforms

### Steps Taken:
- Logged into the SIEM and identified the triggered alert

- Filtered logs by IP address and username involved in the alert
- Found multiple failed logins from IP `101.53.12.18`
- Checked IP on threat intel site â€“ confirmed as known malicious
- Correlated login attempts with known working hours â€“ suspicious timing
- Verified it was not a false positive (user confirmed they werenâ€™t active)

## Sample Splunk Queries Used
